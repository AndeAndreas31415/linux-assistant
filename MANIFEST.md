Linux Assistant has the goal to assist linux users in their daily use and at administrative tasks. 
It's mission is to unite the major part of the linux community and to profit from synergy effects.
The aim is to support all major and well known linux distributions and desktops.
As long as a certain function or workflow is essential or technically necessary for a distribution, 
it should be payed attention to it and supported/integrated as far as possible and meaningful.
For recommendations of software free software should be preferred to proprietary one, 
as long the free (alternative) is well adapted in the community and has similar functionality.
The installation of Linux Assistant should be very easy. 
As few dependencies as possible should be used.
